## Installation

### Windows Installation (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd swarm-trade
```

2. Run the Windows installer:
```bash
install_windows.bat
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
copy .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Manual Installation

If you encounter Windows Long Path errors, try the lightweight version:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-lite.txt
```

For the full version with machine learning features:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Troubleshooting Windows Long Path Issue

If you get the TensorFlow installation error:

1. **Enable Windows Long Path support:**
   - Open Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc)
   - Navigate to: Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Filesystem
   - Enable "Enable Win32 long paths"

2. **Alternative installation:**
   ```bash
   pip install --user tensorflow
   pip install --user scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Use the lite version:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-lite.txt
   ```
   This version works without TensorFlow and scikit-learn.

## Usage

### Command Line

**Single Analysis:**
```bash
python main.py

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ScreenshotCapture** (`src/screenshot_capture.py`)
   - Automated screenshot capture
   - Window-specific capture
   - Chart area detection

2. **ImageAnalyzer** (`src/image_analyzer.py`)
   - Computer vision analysis
   - Pattern recognition
   - Technical indicator extraction

3. **NewsAnalyzer** (`src/news_analyzer.py`)

### Signal Generation Algorithm

The system uses a weighted scoring approach:

```
Final Score = (Technical × 0.4) + (Sentiment × 0.3) + (Patterns × 0.2) + (Volume × 0.1)
```

Signals are generated when:
- Final score > 0.6 (BUY signal)
